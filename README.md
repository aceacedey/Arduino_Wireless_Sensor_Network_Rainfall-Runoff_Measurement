###Chord DHT Implementation in C/C++
This project is an implementation of a Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The system is designed to simulate a distributed key-value store by spawning multiple processes on a single Unix/Linux-based machine, where each process acts as a node in the DHT ring.
The project consists of a C++ backend that manages the DHT logic and a simple C-based command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
