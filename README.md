## Distributed Computing Project
### Chord DHT Implementation in C/C++ (Coursework - Distributed Computing)
This project is an implementation of a Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The system is designed to simulate a distributed key-value store by spawning multiple processes on a single Unix/Linux-based machine, where each process acts as a node in the DHT ring.
The project consists of a C++ backend that manages the DHT logic and a simple C-based command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

## CMOS_Camera_Codes
Contains the source code of integrating OV7670 CMOS camera with Arduino and make it compatible with Quadcopters.

## Quadcopter_Codes
Contains dev codes for a custom made quadcopter. Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtLcCc_VHIg
